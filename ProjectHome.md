Tribute to diablo 2, you will play as a sorceress, I'm aiming to create a big world with nice lore coming from sanctuary's.

This homebrew made for nintendo ds can be compiled with latest devkitpro/arm, libnds(included  with devkitpro) and the ulibrary made by brunni.
Some hot-fixes and changes have been made by myself for the ulibrary, so I included it in the svn.


Any suggestion/help is welcome.
